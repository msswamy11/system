# system

System = Micro controller [or] Micro processor [or] some circuit to do required task for human.
GPIO -> Input mode, Output mode.
Keyboard, display

When you power on your system, voltage will be applied to your circuit and then to controller/processor. How voltage supply propagates and the sequence in which peripherals get voltage on circuit board called power sequencing.
Once votage applied to controller/processor its initial ROM code will start executing to find and load its authenticated firmware for the processor/controller initializations, that includes peripherals, IO, and memory.
