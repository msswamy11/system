GPIOs cacn be configured as input and ouput using configuration register. In general by default all GPIOs configured as input.
Input mode:
  If left unconnected, act as floating hence high impedence mode. Power leakage from Vcc to GND and wastage of power.

Ouput mode:
  Push-pull: Both PMOS and NMOS transistors are present.
    If input 0, output is 0.
    If input 1, output is 1.
  Open drain: Only NMOS transistor present.
    If input is 0, output is 0.
    If input is 1, output is Floating. (Not useful)
  Open drain with pull up(Internal/External):
    I/P 0 -> O/P 0
    I/P 1 -> O/P 1
